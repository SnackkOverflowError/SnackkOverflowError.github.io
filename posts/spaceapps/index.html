My team decided to make a website that could predict if your town will become a covid hotspot based on past data of covid hotspots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\u0022features\u0022\u003eFeatures\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe website was written with flutter, and asked the user for information about their city. These values would be sent to a flask server where they would be passed into a classifier trained using data provided by different government agencies (as well as data we manually collected). The flask server would then return whether it was likely that the city would become a covid hotspot or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e',delay:'1',autoStart:!0})</script>
